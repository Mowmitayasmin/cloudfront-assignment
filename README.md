# cloudfront-assignment

## Deployment Explanation

I created a simple static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stored it in a GitHub repository called `cloudfront-assignment`.

To deploy the site, I used **GitHub Pages**:

- I went to the **Settings > Pages** section in my repository.
- I selected the **main branch** and set the root (`/`) folder as the source.
- GitHub automatically deployed the site and provided a live URL:  
    https://mowmitayasmin.github.io/cloudfront-assignment/

GitHub Pages also enforces **HTTPS**, which means the site is delivered securely.

The deployment process is simple and free, making it a great choice for hosting static sites.
